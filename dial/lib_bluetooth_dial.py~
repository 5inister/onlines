# This program provides the functionality for a quadrature rotary encoder
# to act as a bluetooth keuboard. All the Bluetooth-Keyboard functionality
# was lifted from http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/emulate-a-bluetooth-keyboard-with-the-raspberry-pi
# Quoting this website:
# PiTooth allows the Raspberry Pi to act as a Bluetooth keyboard, and relays
# keypresses from a USB keyboard to a Bluetooth client. Written by Liam Fraser
# for a Linux User & Developer tutorial.

# This was written by Diego Trujillo-Pisanty at Newcastel University (UK) 
# for the Charting the Digital Lifespan Project.
